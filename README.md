My Family tree is a site that you can upload your family members' photo to make a svg family tree.
https://jeserlin.github.io/MyFamilyTree/myFamilyTree<br>

## I'm using:

* Javascript ES6
* Jquery 3.3.1
* Bootstrap 4.0
* svg
* sessionStorage

## Feature

### 1.Create Family Tree
In the first page, you can type in the family members information.<br>

* Gender</br>
* Name</br>
* Photo</br>

It's OK if you don't have any photo, just choose the gender of the family member, this site will help you fill an image base on the gender automatically.<br>

Be aware that the name is necesscary, if you didn't fill this input your family member will not appear in the Family Tree!
